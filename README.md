# User Stories
User Stories (MVP)
As a user, I want a webpage that displays individual store data for my Salmon Cookie Shops, so that I can be informed about how to run my business
As a developer, I want to represent the store data in a list format on the webpage, so my client can view the information
As a developer, I want to use object-oriented programming to build this site, so that the site will be more effective and the code will be easier to read and understand
